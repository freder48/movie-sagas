### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- PostgreSQL
- React-redux

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Users can click on the movie title buttons on the home page to see the details of that movie.
2. Users can click the edit button on the details page to change the movie title and description.
3. Click on the Add Movie link to direct to a form to submit a new movie to list
